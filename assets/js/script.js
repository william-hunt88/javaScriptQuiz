// AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers - GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score
